## üöÄ Running the Application

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5001` or `http://0.0.0.0:5001`.

For production deployment, refer to the example configurations provided:
*   `ai_tts_nginx.conf` for Nginx setup.
*   `tts_app.service` for systemd service setup.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes several API endpoints:

*   `GET /`: Serves the main HTML page.
*   `POST /api/generate`: Generates TTS audio.
    *   **Payload (JSON)**: `{ "text": "...", "engine": "gemini/edge", "voice": "...", ... }`
*   `GET /api/voices/<engine>`: Retrieves available voices for the specified engine (`gemini` or `edge`).
*   `GET /api/download/<filename>`: Downloads the generated audio file.
*   `POST /api/batch`: Batch TTS generation.
    *   **Payload (JSON)**: `{ "texts": ["text1", "text2"], "config": { ...tts_params... } }`

---

## üé® Customization

*   **Voices & Languages**: Modify `TTSConfig.LANGUAGES` and `TTSConfig.VOICE_PROFILES` in `app.py` to add or change supported languages and voices.
*   **Frontend**: The UI is built with Tailwind CSS. You can customize styles in `index.html` or by modifying Tailwind's configuration if you set up a build process.
